# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning techniques. The main goal is to build a predictive model that can identify potential frauds based on transaction data.

---

## 📁 File Included

- `main.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the entire fraud detection workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a machine learning model capable of classifying credit card transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**, with a focus on:

- Handling imbalanced datasets
- Evaluating model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Reducing false positives and false negatives

---

## 🧠 ML Techniques Used

- Logistic Regression

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Based on a real-world dataset containing **anonymized credit card transactions**.
- Features are numerical values resulting from PCA transformation.
- Contains both **legitimate** and **fraudulent** transactions.

> Note: Due to confidentiality, sensitive attributes like cardholder info are not included.

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
